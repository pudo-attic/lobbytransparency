EU Lobby Transparency Project
=============================

This is the source repository for ETL scripts and backend logic used to parse the 
European Parliament and Commission database of registered interests. The database
is published in an XML format but needs to be cleansed and reconciled to be of
any use.

This project is run by a coalition of ALTER EU, Corporate Europe Observatory, 
LobbyControl, Friends of the Earth Europe and OKFN Labs.
