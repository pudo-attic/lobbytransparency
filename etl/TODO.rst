What is the final data model?
-----------------------------

* Do we want to produce a single entity table with natural persons and 
  organizations of various types combined in it?
* How do we store historic data - do we flag current revisions with a 
  special flag?
* Where does manual editing (e.g. classification) happen: ETL or 
  production? 

Deduplication
-------------

* Use custom deduplication code or Center of Responsive Politics code?
